# Simple Reminder

## Description

This project is a lightweight web application for simple task management.

The goal was to make it as simple, intuitive, and efficient as possible. Users can add tasks, check them off, change their order, and delete them. The application uses local storage to preserve your tasks, even after closing the browser.

## Objectives

- Build the project entirely from scratch, intentionally avoiding any frameworks.
- Improve my JavaScript skills through hands-on development.
- Deliver a minimalist result aligned with the original concept.
